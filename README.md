In this assignment we developed cloud game prototype in concept of adventure game ("Cloudtopia").

**The code is available in our Google Colab page in this link:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nAKxOCsUVoGf6NYYv49A85g5X0ja8X2Y#scrollTo=tXIDXEwEE2dC

We designed several screens with few features of basic functionality (pressing buttons, moving to a new screen and etc).

<ins>The screens include:</ins> 
  
* Manager screen for adding and editing questions, 
  
* preview screen with game description, 
  
* screen showing a question, 
  
* screen showing an indication of a correct/wrong answer, 
  
* game summary screen with a graph illustrating the performance of the player in the current game.

## Assignment 3 part A
HW3.zip

In this assignment we finished the second iteration of our project + writing acceptence tests.

Moreover, the zip includes the following:

* The SUS score given to our system after calculation (Excel file)
  
* Programmer portfolio - main files, main functions, code snippets/interesting design templates

* User portfolio - general explanation of the game, breakdown of screens, transitions between screens and an explanation of optional errors.

## Assignment 3 part B

In this assignment we performed acceptence tests on the 'chameleon' group (according to our acceptence tests).

Also, each of our team members evaluated the 'chameleon' group accrding to 'Code Review Checklist Overview' by Dr. Michaela Greiler.

## Final Project Documantation
