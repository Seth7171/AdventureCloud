In this assignment we developed cloud game prototype in concept of adventure game ("Cloudtopia").

**The code is available in our Google Colab page in this link:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nAKxOCsUVoGf6NYYv49A85g5X0ja8X2Y#scrollTo=tXIDXEwEE2dC

Moreover, the zip includes the following:

* The SUS score given to our system after calculation (Excel file)
  
* Programmer portfolio - main files, main functions, code snippets/interesting design templates

In this assignment we performed acceptence tests on the 'chameleon' group (according to our acceptence tests).

Also, each of our team members evaluated the 'chameleon' group accrding to 'Code Review Checklist Overview' by Dr. Michaela Greiler.
